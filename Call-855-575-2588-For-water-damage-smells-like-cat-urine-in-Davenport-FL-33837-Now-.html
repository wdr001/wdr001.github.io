      Unless you are willing to shell out nearly $100 for a waterproof case, you should be very careful with your iPhone around the pool, during days at the beach, and the most unfortunate location of all…the bathroom.To start the conversation again, simply ask a new question.            Q: water damaged macbook pro Hello,  I spilled water last night which got on my Macbook Pro.  I wiped off the water and moved the computer out of it to dry overnight.  The computer was still on when I moved it as the lid was closed, but it wasn't turned off.  I woke up this morning and it was neither accepting charge from my charger (which is functional) or turning on.  I'm wondering what the best steps at this point would be?

      What impact does the preparedness and skill have on the quality of our work?  We think it’s the difference between an exceptional experience and a nightmare you won’t soon forget.  Too many flood mitigation companies in Buffalo simply don’t follow the right procedures as set forth by the IICRC or don’t have the proper equipment to get the job done.  But when the pieces are in place, the basement water extraction and dry-out process should go smoothly…here’s what that looks like:   Our customers get a 1 year warranty on labor!   We’re a flooding repair company that is serious about providing great service and standing by our work.  And to show customers just how seriously we take that commitment, we offer each customer a 1 year full warranty on labor for all of our flood cleaning & repair services.  If we mess something up, we’ll fix it!
