       As the property begins to dry out, the technician can use the moisture meter to check the progress of the job. 
      Stain the area to match the rest of the floor, and finish with sealant. Again, this will cause the wood to always be wet and decay and attract those destructive termites.

      Thanks for watching! xoxo CharlotteMGray Follow me on: My collab Channel: ... 1 · · · Chipotle OP OP Marked as Helpful Post Nov 7, 2012 at 3:59 UTC I would be checking Better Business Bureau for complaints against HP Service and Support to see if this is happening to others.  Check the scews to see if the laptop was even opened up.  There should be minor damage to all of the screws showing entrance to the device.  If there was water damage, I would expect to see burn damage from electrical components shorting out.

      Mold can be highly damaging to your health and it is very important to remove it before returning your property. You must have authorisation if you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated water to surface waters or groundwater. 
      You can purchase 3M injector cleaner that is for one-time usage. And then change those fluids again in a thousand miles or so if there was evidence of muddy water. 
      Other restoration work may be needed and further assessments of the damage are done usually within the 3 to 5 day structural drying period.

      Unlike some basement flood cleanup companies, we only perform services that are necessary and cost-effective and we only charge the accepted rate for those services. Assuming that process took about a week, spraying would not have begun until August.
