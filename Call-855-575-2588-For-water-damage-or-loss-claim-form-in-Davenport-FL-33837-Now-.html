       CMHC provides this nice summary statement, for which we provide actual how-to details in this article: If they have been soaked, consult an HVAC (Heating,Ventilation and Air Conditioning) contractor to replace the furnace blower motor, switches and controls, insulation and filters.

      This should determine what chemicals are present and it�s possible that you can have work carried out that will lead to you getting more purified water. If you do not find red spot, just go make you smile.   
      In some cases, extreme care must be taken not to damage the items via the drying process itself. That is typically several years at best and a decade or longer in sub-optimal conditions. 
      Transversely if the number is a negative number above -10% then the vehicle is running too rich and the computer is subtracting fuel to aid in its efficiency.
