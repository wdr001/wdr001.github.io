      Despite everything I've read and everyone I've talked to, my apartment manager is somehow convinced that water heaters don't need to be replaced every 10 to 15 years and that the usual thing is to just wait until they go into failure mode and deal with the situation then. (My neighbor's water heater was 20+ years old when it went haywire last week.) What evidence can I give her that, no, this is not the normal state of affairs and that if everyone did this, they'd all be living in soggy, moldy dwellings all the time?

      While we’re looking at the back, though, you can see that the 7D II has thick gaskets around the viewfinder (red arrows), which weren’t there on the 7D.   Back assemblies of the 7D II (left) and 7D (right).   If you look at the back of the camera there’s another thick  gasket around the viewfinder, which makes this area doubly sealed!   After removing the shielding from the backs, it’s obvious the chip sets are completely different.   Canon 7D back with shielding removed.   Canon 7D Mk II with shielding removed.   Obviously, the big jumper flex that crosses the circuit board in the 7D is gone with the 7D II. We sort of hated losing that jumper flex in the center of the camera because we thought it was kind of pretty. Like all CPO programs, a CPO Jeep offers the benefits of both new and used purchasing.    Wood's cellulose fibers rapidly soak up water but only slowly releases that water. 
      Get the iPhone out of the water (lake/bidet/soup) right away, if you haven't already, and don't even think about plugging it in.   
      Using any one or all of these methods can fix a wet iPhone. I always call Bill Howe Plumbing, and recommend their services to State Farm Insurance, neighbors and friends. 
      If you decide enlarging your old photo from its original size, then a general rule of thumb is to double the dpi with every doubling in size. (For example, to produce an 8. If mold is present, that requires its own protocol of cleaning steps.
