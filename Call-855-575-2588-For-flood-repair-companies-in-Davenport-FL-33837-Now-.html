      TFIA worked with my bank to make all the changes needed on our escrow account. The new boards should then be left to acclimate with the new environment before the installation. 
      After you have done this and a wood flooring professional has determined that your wood floor is completely dry, then you can finally refinish your hardwood floors and get them back to looking like new! Therefore, before settlements can be made for water removal or carpet restoration, the contractor needs to know what caused the problem in the first place.

       Date created: 2016-06-25 Name: mitch Location: Arkansas Satisfaction Rating: Very Satisfied, 5 out of 5 Review: "Floor installed right" I have Pergo in my sons bedroom for 14 years with no problems, also installed it in the rest of my home a few years later, its been installed about 10 years, have some water damage in one place where my fridge had a long time leak, I installed my flooring and took an extra precaution of gluing the joints, the only thing I would do different is more caulking around the edges by the walls, these floors have taken a lot of abuse,the Pergo looks almost the same as when I installed it, I have used a swiffer to clean it which is a considerable amount of moisture, most of these floors are interlocking, but interlocking doesn't protect, take the time to glue and you will have a floor for a long time, and I did raise 3 kids and mastiffs in my home, so there was abuse Date created: 2016-03-30 Name: Susan Hellenga Location: Michigan Satisfaction Rating: Very Unsatisfied, 1 out of 5 Review: "Poor materials" Wish we had never wasted the money on Pergo flooring! 
      Have a list of professionals on hand to call, and understand your insurance policy, as some only cover mold damage up to a certain amount, while others don’t provide any reimbursement for mold. For the same reasons stated above. ▪  Put a mark.

      Our goal is to minimize the damage and destruction that comes with water, fire, mold, and biohazard damage. We use the highest quality drying equipment to help minimize any reconstruction after a loss occurs. In other cases, building and repair work may need to take place earlier in the water damage restoration process.
