      INITIAL STEPS TO TAKE -Remove the artwork from the source of the water problem -Try to control or eliminate the source of the water problem -Lay the artwork on a dry flat surface and evaluate the extent of the damage  Framed artworks Remove the frame from your paintings; Water can weaken the bond between the paint film and the ground used to prepare the canvas; therefore, keep wet paintings horizontal and paint-side up.  Art on paper or photos If possible, remove artwork from the frame and follow the procedures for air drying listed below; use extreme caution when attempting to remove the artwork from the frame, as most art objects become weaker when they are wet; the artwork is most likely attached to the matting and backing boards with an adhesive; these adhesives could prove problematic to remove; if the artwork does not come easily out of the frame and or you get resistance when attempted to disassemble the artwork from the matting and backing boards, stop and have the artwork evaluated by a conservator prior to further disassembly; it is better to leave a work on paper in a wet state temporarily rather than risk tearing it.
