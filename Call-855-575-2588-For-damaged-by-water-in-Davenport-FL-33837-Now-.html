      The Home Reference Book - the Encyclopedia of Homes, Carson Dunlop & Associates, Toronto, Ontario, 25th Ed., 2012, is a bound volume of more than 450 illustrated pages that assist home inspectors and home owners in the inspection and detection of problems on buildings. These are seemingly ephemeral issues in the dollars-and-cents calculations of total losses and insurance claims, but they matter to those making the decision to stay and rebuild or pull up stakes and move to less vulnerable locales. 
      The vital precaution is getting a detailed inspection by someone with mechanical expertise. Search over 500 listings to find the best local deals. 
      Large pieces of furniture that are saturated will likely be difficult to dry effectively, and should often be discarded.  Mold growth can be controlled on surfaces by cleaning with a non-ammonia detergent or pine oil cleaner and disinfecting with a 10% bleach solution. (Caution: Never mix ammonia and bleach products, as the resulting fumes can be highly toxic.) Always test this solution on a small area of the item or area you’re cleaning to be sure it doesn’t cause staining or fading.  Take photographs before removing wet wallboards and baseboards because insurers will want to see the height of any water damage to walls.  Carefully poke holes at floor level in the drywall to allow water trapped behind it to escape.  You may also wish to hire a flood restoration service—you can find pros under “Flood” or “Disaster recovery” in your local phone book, or check with the Better Business Bureau, local Chamber of Commerce, or contractor recommendation sites, such as Angieslist.com or MerchantCircle.com.    
      Carson Dunlop Associates' provides extensive home inspection education and report writing material. Condensation Heavy condensation can sometimes drip, resulting in standing moisture around the base of your toilet.

      Mark them and press " Recover" button to get them back.   
      Often the seller is living a pipe dream if he thinks the car is worth the asking price, no matter how much they put into it, a flooded car is never worth nearly as much as a non-flooded car. Water damage services to respond quickly, act knowledgeably, and save you. 
      This is much more important than all the decorating and beautifying of the home. You will probably find when you come back to it that the leather dressing has almost completely soaked in, if it seems somewhat dry in places apply a bit more as you buff the entire surface.
