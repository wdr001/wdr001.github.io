      I took the laptop to the Genius bar where they told me the motherboard was fried and the laptop was dead. It’s common for a homeowner to have a tile or flooring installer reset the toilet back on the flange, after tile work is completed. 
      When trying to take underwater photos? And now you want to dry it out, fix the water damage, and recover the data inside? A good response time to begin water damage repair should be within 24-48 hours after the actual event takes place to prevent the growth of mold. 
      Located in Denver CO, our clients are our partners and we are committed to their growth and success.
