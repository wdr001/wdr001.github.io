      IF POSSIBLE, Disconnect the Battery Most new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models have internal batteries making this impossible, but if the Mac has a removable battery, take it out immediately. Luckily, there's a wealth of information out there that can clue you in to how to fix these problems without seeking pro help. 
      Tyler came out next day to assess the damage and roof replacement was definitely needed.  He worked up a quote asap, including plywood, metal flashing, replacement 1x2's that were rotted.  I got quotes from others and they were well in line and fair.  Tyler followed up a few times as the bids were coming in and we sealed the deal that Friday.  Materials were dropped off that next Tuesday [day after Christmas] and guys showed early next morning.  Even though cold and drizzly, they got it knocked out in one day.  Tyler came on site to see how the work was going.  Quality of workmanship was fantastic, crew did a really good job with clean up. They quickly invite structural damage and toxic cultures. 
      If the home is habitable, take precautions to keep yourself and your family safe from injury. I loved the fantastic customer service they have provided from the beginning to the end, and then some! we are definitely going to gro through them again with anything we need done with our house.
