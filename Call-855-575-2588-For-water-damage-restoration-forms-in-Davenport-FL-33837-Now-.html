      It's a good idea is to check with your home insurance agent to be sure that you have the required coverage in case you become the victim of home water damage. If the water is coming from an inside source, such as a toilet or sink, find the shut-off valve and turn it off immediately.

Federal and provincial government workers are told to stay home to alleviate traffic congestion for emergency workers to deal with flooding.
