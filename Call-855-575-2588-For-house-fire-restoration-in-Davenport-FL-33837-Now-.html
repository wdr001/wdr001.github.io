       The owner had used the rice technique and the iPhone had worked fine afterwards... initially. 
      Depending upon what caused the flood and respond time, wet timber floorboards develop unpleasant odor..  A black stain can indicate greater issues, such as mold growth.

      3 · · · Habanero OP Nov 7, 2012 at 1:20 UTC Wow, that's a long post from a phone!  I'm with Nick42, look for the little stickers in the consumer accessible areas that indicate water damage.  The most readily available examples are typically in cellphone battery compartments, but there are also often some of these in "warranty breaking" places...  meaning you'll have to remove screws to get to them.  I suspect your only real option is to hammer their support folks who most likely hear "this was nowhere near liquids" from every laptop that gets sent in with coffee spilled on it. Damage from water leaks and pipe breaks require immediate emergency flood service water extraction, fast clean up and dry out. 
      Unfortunately, I can’t say the same thing happened when I dunked an old iPod touch (apparently, I like to collect iPods) in some water. At this point, you might be starting those necessary repairs and could find the following checklist helpful.

       This will hold the board firmly in place until the cement adhesive dries. If the wet carpet cannot be treated within the 24 hours, then it is better to have professionals remove and replace it. 
      We get homes back to the condition they were in before the water event, with minimal loss of property, and we get businesses back in full operation in as little time as possible. “Happily. They will visit the site, collect data about overall damage, and will suggest the best ways to diagnose the trouble.

       I suspect water gathers at this lip when it drips.
