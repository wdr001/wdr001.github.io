       I’m leaving plenty out because I frankly don’t want you to do anything other than find another car that doesn’t have flood damage. 
      If the wet iPhone is in a case, remove it; take the SIM card out too. (Removing the battery wouldn't hurt either, but this is obviously only for confident DIY-type users who are willing to void the warranty.) These steps help to reduce the number of nooks and crannies where water can linger, and help to avoid damage to key iPhone components.    
      We may have our differences as people, but we continue to act in the best interest of everyone. Download the free and trial version to have a try! 
      If your car or a car you are considering purchasing has been flooded in fresh water, it is possible to rebuild it. The water damage sensors in the iPhone are small adhesive pads that are initially white, but turn irreversibly red or pink when exposed to “dangerous” levels of moisture.
