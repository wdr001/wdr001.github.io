       Step 1: Emergency Contact Step 2: Inspection and Damage Assessment Step 3: Water Removal/Water Extraction Step 4: Drying and Dehumidification Step 5: Cleaning and Sanitizing Step 6: Restoration Common Water Damage Scenarios Water damage can have many sources, from loose appliance hoses to natural disasters.

      Warmer temperatures may speed up corrosion, especially if your car was flooded with salt water. Large pieces of furniture that are saturated will likely be difficult to dry effectively, and should often be discarded.  Mold growth can be controlled on surfaces by cleaning with a non-ammonia detergent or pine oil cleaner and disinfecting with a 10% bleach solution. (Caution: Never mix ammonia and bleach products, as the resulting fumes can be highly toxic.) Always test this solution on a small area of the item or area you’re cleaning to be sure it doesn’t cause staining or fading.  Take photographs before removing wet wallboards and baseboards because insurers will want to see the height of any water damage to walls.  Carefully poke holes at floor level in the drywall to allow water trapped behind it to escape.  You may also wish to hire a flood restoration service—you can find pros under “Flood” or “Disaster recovery” in your local phone book, or check with the Better Business Bureau, local Chamber of Commerce, or contractor recommendation sites, such as Angieslist.com or MerchantCircle.com. 
      We take great care in protecting your home and belongings.   There is no reduction in value because of a previous damage situation, as long as the unit was restored to the original or better condition during the repair. (No Chosen Answer) 1.
