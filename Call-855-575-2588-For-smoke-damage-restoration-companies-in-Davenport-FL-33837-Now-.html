      But in some situations it may be the only way to save the day - and if nothing else works and you're out of warranty, you may find yourself with nothing to lose. Thank you so much to Paul, Eddie, Jeff, and the other two gentleman who worked on our home. 
      Here is an example of a non-affected Samsung liquid damage indicator: If your device was exposed to moisture or water, the LDI will turn solid pink, red or purple. Look carefully for evidence that the vehicle has been wet: i.e., mud in unusual places in the trunk, water marks inside the instruments, an owner's manual that looks like it's been wet, warped fiberboard door panels or glovebox interiors.However there is one area of the used car business that has remained a mainstay for decades – flooded cars.

       Not everybody we send for the purpose of restoration. 
      SERVPRO Franchise Professionals respond immediately and use advanced equipment and techniques to remove the water quickly.    We live in Kansas in an area where it rarely to never floods but we are required to have flood insurance since we are within the 100 year flood plain. 
      The technicians were on-time and worked quickly and efficiently. We will safely remove any items that will need to be restored at an offsite facility and clear the affected areas so that we can begin the flood restoration process.   Step 3.   People are extremely satisfied with what we’ve done; just read what they’re saying about Kiwi Services. “This technician was very helpful and efficient. 
      The Technicians were here 45 minutes after my phone call, they were all well informed and polite.
