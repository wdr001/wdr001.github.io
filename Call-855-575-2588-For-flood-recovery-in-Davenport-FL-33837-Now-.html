      Around the perimeter of the patch, skim the mud as thin as possible with the joint knife to help blend it into the surrounding surface. Soon after thoroughly extracting every bit of water, the drying procedure is commenced.

       The water droplets could easily reach the exposed connectors and cause it to either oxidize or destroy the circuit together.
