       He had identified that the capacitor was not functioning and replaced it. 
      My first question is, if I take the phone back to Apple while it is having these water-related issues, is it likely that I could get a replacement at the cost of only the $299 out-of-warranty service fee, or is it more probable that Apple would deem the phone irreparable and charge me the full replacement fee (i.e. the full cost of a new phone)? Priorities The order of removal and treatment is: First, the most highly valued; second, the least damaged; third, slightly damaged; and fourth, severely damaged.    To make a claim you need to contact your insurance provider and speak with the adjuster, be prepared to provide: Photos of the damaged area claimed. 
      By decreasing the severity of the water damage, you increase your savings and reduce the amount of water damage repair and replacement you need to tackle. There’s just something about getting every shot in focus every time that’s appealing to me.
