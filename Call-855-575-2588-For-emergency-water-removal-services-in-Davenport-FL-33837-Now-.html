      If the seller knows the vehicle has water damage, they might try to cover it with floor mats. Commercial vacuums or contractors with only flooring drying out equipment can not actually prevent water from wicking up walls, under baseboards and molding or into sill plates. 
      For instance, if you have a hole in your roofing that is causing water to come in, then it may be necessary to repair this damage before the rest of the restoration services can begin.This is a service that involves going into a home or business after a wet disaster, such as flood, burst pipes, or snow destruction, and not just cleaning up the mess, but actually drying and repairing the substructures that high volumes of moisture will affect, such as plaster and drywall, wood, concrete, and metal. The display is mounted within a NEMA 1 enclosure for indoor use or NEMA 4 for outdoors.
