      Useful Ways To Deal With The Damage Water damage is more than just an expensive nuisance for homeowners. Not only can mold be deadly if you’re exposed to it for extended lengths of time, it can be expensive to remove. 
      It might be awhile if there was a disaster and the area isn't deemed safe. Otherwise, to blend, paint over the entire surface (for very large areas, do two square sections at a time) with one-directional, overlapping, non-diagonal strokes once again. 
      When the lost files are recovered, you can keep your Contacts, SMS, Photos, Videos, Calendar and Notes on your computer as a backup, to avoid losing your data the next time. Refresh this Yelp page and try your search again.

However after removing the plate protecting the connections where the screen connects to the logic board, (It felt the hottest to touch and so I removed it) the phone whilst still being unresponsive appears to have stopped heating up (mostly, its still a little warm but no where near as much) and the proximity sensor has come back.
