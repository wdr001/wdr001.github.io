      Water, dirt and rust under the hood are all indicative of a flood-damaged car. While you should take advantage of the above steps, your intuitions are going to be reliable. 
      If possible, remove a few boards to provide additional ventilation for floors that have sustained prolonged flooding. What makes this different for you as a customer is that you really don’t need to shop around (and you really don’t have time to shop around!).  All reputable Tulsa water damage companies should be using the same software and should come up with essentially the same price!   Know the dangers of shoddy water damage repair service…    Anytime water saturates your property, there’s a couple of things that are top of mind when performing the water damage repair process:   Damage to the structure Any type of water, whether it’s clean drinking water or dirty sewage, will cause damage as it sits in your floors, walls & ceilings.  The greatest imminent danger is that the damage will occur to parts of your home or office that act as structural support that keep everything from falling down on your head.  That’s why one key aspect of our job is to find and inspect all damaged areas to make sure that the flooding event has not risked the structural integrity of your property.   Black mold Especially in a humid, hot place like Tulsa, black mold is always a threat…and it doesn’t take much time at all or much moisture at all for it to start growing and causing problems.  Black mold, at high enough levels, can make anyone that comes into contact with it very sick.  As such, it’s treated as an environmental hazard and must be dealt with accordingly.  It’s a huge headache and extremely expensive to remediate, which is why we go to great lengths throughout the water damage cleanup process to prevent mold from ever taking root! 
      Let The Repairs Begin Before we go on any further, we want to point out that you should speak with a professional before you begin any DIY repairs.
