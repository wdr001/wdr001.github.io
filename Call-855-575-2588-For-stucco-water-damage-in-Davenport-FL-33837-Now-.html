The cooling system uses the stuff to regulate engine temperatures and regular use of a soapy bucket of H20 and a sponge can go a long way toward keeping your pride and joy looking tip-top. 
      It is important to take prompt action to restore the normal conditions at sites otherwise the situation may go worst in terms of property damage as well as medical health problems. What impact does the preparedness and skill have on the quality of our work?  We think it’s the difference between an exceptional experience and a nightmare you won’t soon forget.  Too many flood mitigation companies in Buffalo simply don’t follow the right procedures as set forth by the IICRC or don’t have the proper equipment to get the job done.  But when the pieces are in place, the basement water extraction and dry-out process should go smoothly…here’s what that looks like:   Our customers get a 1 year warranty on labor!   We’re a flooding repair company that is serious about providing great service and standing by our work.  And to show customers just how seriously we take that commitment, we offer each customer a 1 year full warranty on labor for all of our flood cleaning & repair services.  If we mess something up, we’ll fix it!
