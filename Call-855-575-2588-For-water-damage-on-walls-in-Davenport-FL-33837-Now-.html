      Try a different battery If there is no response to a charger and your phone will not power on after being exposed to liquid then the first thing I recommend is to attempt to locate a different battery to try in the phone. Economists' reaction was one of surprise about the size of the levy, and the government's continued goal to return the budget to surplus by 2012-13.
