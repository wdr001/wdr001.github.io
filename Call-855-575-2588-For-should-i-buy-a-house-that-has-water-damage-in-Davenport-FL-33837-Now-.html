      New England has some of the oldest residential buildings in the nation and our customers are on constant building and remodeling so they need a contractor with professionalism and experience they trust. The basic goal is always the same, to clean up the water and dry everything out. 
      Whether it’s an overflowing toilet in a bathroom, a leaking pipe in the kitchen or a treacherous storm that floods your basement, we’ll be there to fix the problem quickly, effectively and safely. I was also starting to get vertigo and was convinced that it had to be related to maybe presence of mold in my house, maybe in the attic or the basement. 
      This should mean that (for a large number of users at least) water-damaged iPhones will become a thing of the past, although taking it deeper than 1m or keeping it submerged for longer than half an hour might still cause problems.

       If you are noticing ceiling damage, there is going to be additional damage to the roof, inside walls, or your ceiling support structure.   A vulnerable roof that has loose shingles, leaks around the fireplace, unattended eaves or fascia where termites will land – find a hole – and start a colony, may go unnoticed for many years.
