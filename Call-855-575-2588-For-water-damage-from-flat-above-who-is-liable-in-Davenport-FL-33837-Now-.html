      The technician did work for my sister, and they were very helpful. We appreciate you guys so much and will definitely recommend your company to our friends & family! brook danos reviewed 2 years ago As I was putting my condo up for sale, I had an inspection done, it showed that I apparently had mold. 
      Ignore any ridges left by the knife blade or other inconsistencies in the surface, when the mud has set you can scrape them off before applying another coat. #4- Scrape and Sand Let the mud set until it hardens and then use the joint knife to scrape off any ridges or other roughness in the surface. It’s wise to make sure your insurance covers water related problems. 
      You must complete repairs or replace your property within a certain number of days from the date of loss.
