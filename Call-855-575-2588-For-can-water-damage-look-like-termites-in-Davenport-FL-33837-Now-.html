       Large pieces of furniture that are saturated will likely be difficult to dry effectively, and should often be discarded.  Mold growth can be controlled on surfaces by cleaning with a non-ammonia detergent or pine oil cleaner and disinfecting with a 10% bleach solution. (Caution: Never mix ammonia and bleach products, as the resulting fumes can be highly toxic.) Always test this solution on a small area of the item or area you’re cleaning to be sure it doesn’t cause staining or fading.  Take photographs before removing wet wallboards and baseboards because insurers will want to see the height of any water damage to walls.  Carefully poke holes at floor level in the drywall to allow water trapped behind it to escape.  You may also wish to hire a flood restoration service—you can find pros under “Flood” or “Disaster recovery” in your local phone book, or check with the Better Business Bureau, local Chamber of Commerce, or contractor recommendation sites, such as Angieslist.com or MerchantCircle.com. I had a problem with my thermostat and they came in, replaced it and then checked out both my A/C and heating.
