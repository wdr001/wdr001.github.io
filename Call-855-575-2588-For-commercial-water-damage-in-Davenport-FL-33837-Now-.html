       This might mean finding a stop-tap to isolate your water supply, it might mean using sandbags to minimize further flooding or it might mean sealing a leak in your ceiling/roof. If the insurance adjuster finds out that the damage was caused by an old roof in need of replacement, the damage wouldn't be covered. 
      Nhim Vanda, vice chairman of the NCDM, said that after the floods receded, the committee anticipated $500 million in damage, but that reports showed a much lower repairs bill across the country once local authorities had completed the restorations. “We saw that we lost so much in the flood damage in 2013, [but] we found that only $356 million was spent [after we restored the infrastructure].” The report studied the social, economic and infrastructure sectors in order to assess the costs of the clean-up. Watch out: even if the heater will "run" after having been flooded it may not be safe to use without inspection, repair, and perhaps replacement of any controls that were wet.

      Sallenger, an oceanographer, traces the insidious link between the environmental deaths across the Mississippi delta and the human deaths that occurred when the storm swept ashore. Nhim Vanda, vice chairman of the NCDM, said that after the floods receded, the committee anticipated $500 million in damage, but that reports showed a much lower repairs bill across the country once local authorities had completed the restorations. “We saw that we lost so much in the flood damage in 2013, [but] we found that only $356 million was spent [after we restored the infrastructure].” The report studied the social, economic and infrastructure sectors in order to assess the costs of the clean-up.
