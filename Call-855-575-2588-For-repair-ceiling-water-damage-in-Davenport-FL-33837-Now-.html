      After the labor is completed, water damage equipment including air movers, air scrubbers, dehumidifiers, wood floor drying systems, and sub floor drying equipment is left in the residence. Our Team Relies on Thermal Imaging for Moisture Detection By using thermal imaging for moisture detection, our technicians are able to spot moisture buildups, sources of mold, and other elements of water damage without causing further damage to your structure.

      Damaged areas larger than 12 square inches may need a complete replacement panel installed because large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. Your boots are now a popular fashion item, but first and foremost they are boots which are meant to be worn to protect your feet from the elements including rain.   The video below outlines our services and explains the common steps we take during the water mitigation and reconstruction process:   We dry-out flooded homes before mold grows!   While there are certainly many things we want to address during the mitigation process, black mold is public enemy number one.  While we live in a dry climate, mold can still become pervasive quickly.  To ensure it doesn’t become a problem, we must remove all excess moisture from your walls, floors, ceilings or anywhere else it might have traveled. 
      There’s 2 things that we do during the water damage restoration process to prevent mold: 1) We get your property dry quickly There’s no greater deterrent for mold growth than not giving it enough time to take root and not giving it a hospitable environment.  So the quicker we dry out your property, the less likely you are to have mold.
