       It took out several areas nearby: my garage, my kitchen cabinets, the pantry, even the tile in the kitchen was floating under my refrigerator! 
      We know that if we find a certain severity of damage to a roof during a roof inspection, then we also can conduct some precise tests to measure the amount of moisture in the walls (as well as insert a camera through a small, easily hidden opening to look for signs of mold contamination).

      The technician and his employees were on time each day, very courteous and helpful in a time of need. Since life isn’t that simple and most of us don’t like to liquid damage our devices on purpose, prevention is the cure that will work 100%. 
      There are steps you can take to save your device. I called them before I sent my phone in and they said they were getting so much business that it would take 3 - 5 days to fix my phone. 
      Here’s how that works:   How do you spot the water damage?   In some areas it will be obvious, but you’d be surprised to learn that most moisture can’t be spotted by the human eye until it’s too late.  So to combat hidden moisture, we have a wealth of moisture detection systems we use depending on the surface type we’re checking for water damage.  In some cases we’ll use a moisture probe that has a prong on it that can be inserted into the surface to determine the moisture content of the surface. The damage is often the result of an incorrect air/fuel mixture, incorrect timing, or misfiring spark plugs.

       Just for kicks and giggles, check out the video below to see how well these DIY options would work in protecting your phone (you’d be surprised!) Get yourself a waterproof case Especially for the beach crabs among you, a better investment than buying a brand new phone after every visit to the waters is getting a waterproof case for your device. Place trays or trivets on the coffee table to hold drink glasses. 
      Wear a cartridge respirator with P100 filters, gloves, and goggles. A Tyvek suit is also advisable for larger areas. Extract unreadable iTunes or iCloud backup, view the details of backup file and selectively select the contents you need to restore, you don't need to restore whole backup to iPhone, avoid the newly existing data on iPhone being overwritten.    The staff is friendly and very efficient – a far cry from how the NFIP works.
