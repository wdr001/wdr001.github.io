      More info will be released as it's available, but rest assured, like all other ID products, they will be among the best available. *Update Jan 2016*  - In the development of our coming fuel filters, we tested a lot of the filters on the market.   We found the 10 micron stainless elements on the market to be far from 10 micron, catching almost nothing all  the way up to 25 micron, as seen in the test below.    The 10 micron stainless elements that we have tested are not suitable for Injector Dynamics fuel injectors. Usually the cost will be around $130 (this was a quote on a DNA with a cracked screen.) I don't know how much the M8 screen is to replace but the M7 in the UK costs 170 ($280) in Carphone Warehouse. 
      Our experience with them was great - their communication, price and workmanship.  Thanks again! Watch out: sooting gas fired heating equipment is very dangerous and risks production of fatal carbon monoxide gases in the building.
