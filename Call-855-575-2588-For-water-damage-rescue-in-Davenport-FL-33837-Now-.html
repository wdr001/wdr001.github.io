      Stir the primer, or shake the can vigorously to be sure it's completely mixed. The current ones show no corrosion/wear - but figured while its opened up this might be a good opportunity to get it slightly modded Thanks all, Bob Last edited by bob01; September 22nd, 2010 at 20:01.

      Depending on the size of the room, the quality of wood and the going rate of the installers, you could easily spend several thousands of dollars fixing the damage (now you see why preventing water damage in the first place is so important!).

       Complete Reports on Incidents Involving Water Damage Floods and other major disasters involving water are notoriously difficult to report to insurance companies. 
      We’ve helped people all over Houston and in the rest of the country recover after water damage.    
      This approach is guided by the following steps: Removal of Standing Water Stagnant water is the most common sign of a water damaged home or business premise. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. 
      Moreover, the iPhone water damage repair cost is not so reasonable. Brush off the dust and wipe the surface with a damp rag to remove any joint compound residue. 
      Dripping Springs, TX 0 friends 3 reviews 11/2/2017 I highly recommend Brad Farr and Water Damage Restoration and Roofing of Austin!!  I needed a new roof in a hurry to sell my house which was under contract !  Brad came to my home and explained the process, pricing and materials.  The work was done on time and handled in a pleasant and professional manner.   Excellent communication from start to finish!  This is the roofing contractor you need to call!   
      Basically, I treat the place almost like it were my own. (if it were mine, I’d spend money on some upgrades!) Good luck. Try a different battery If there is no response to a charger and your phone will not power on after being exposed to liquid then the first thing I recommend is to attempt to locate a different battery to try in the phone. 
      There’s always an option to vacuum seal it in plastic with the one you have around the house, drop it into a slim vacuum packed jar, or just drop it into latex and get some protection right away. Whether there was a tiny or a large spill on your water damaged hardwood floor, the first thing you must do to save your hardwood floor is to eliminate any excess water that has not been absorbed by the wood floor yet by simply drying your wood floor with a cloth or grabbing a water vacuum. 
      We offer free on-site sewage damage cleanup estimates, just call now!   Have water damage to a commercial property?   Any water loss presents an emergency, but when it comes to a commercial property, it’s imperative you get your business back online.  Down time or damaged products mean losses and could determine your year’s bottom line.  At RestorationEze, we provide complete commercial water damage services in Houston and the surrounding areas.  Our restoration contractors have plenty of trucks and crews available, meaning we can get onsite within minutes and have the equipment and resources to immediately get to work getting your business back up and running!   Know what to expect before work begins…   Water damage cleanup & repair services must be tailored to the property that has experience the loss.  But there are some things you can expect to see should you allow us to cleanup your water loss.  Watch this video to learn about the steps commonly taken during the water mitigation & reconstruction process:   Common mistakes homeowners make with Houston water damage   It’s probably a first, so it’s not unusual for you to have some questions about how to get past this event.  Sadly, unanswered questions usually lead to mistakes, and mistakes lead to headaches and more expenses.  At RestorationEze, our goal is for you to have the smoothest possible water damage restoration services as possible.  So here’s some common mistakes we see people make everyday.  We hope you don’t let them happen to you!   Waiting for their adjuster to initiate the process It’s 8:30 at night and you’re watching TV in your living room and water starts dripping through the ceiling from the second floor.  All of a sudden you realize your kid left the bathtub running and there is water every where.  You need it cleaned up fast and realize that if you wait you’ll end up with black mold.  So does it make sense to leave a message with your insurance company in the hopes they call you back the next day and send someone out a few days later?  Absolutely not!
