       Rainwater pits around the house can drain the water away from your home. If the wet iPhone is in a case, remove it; take the SIM card out too. (Removing the battery wouldn't hurt either, but this is obviously only for confident DIY-type users who are willing to void the warranty.) These steps help to reduce the number of nooks and crannies where water can linger, and help to avoid damage to key iPhone components. 
      Resist the temptation to use a hair dryer or other heat treatment, as this can damage the iPhone's internal components. (A few iPhone users advise the use of a non-heated fan, mind you, which at least shouldn't make things worse, even if we think the below techniques are likely to be more effective.) To get moisture out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. You can expect costs of about GBP 50 for repair services of your mobile device.

      We would therefore advise that, if you're lucky enough to be able to get your iPhone to run after a dip, you should back up all important files on the device in case it packs up again in the future.
